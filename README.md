# Epic-Boss-Fighter
A simple boss fighting game. Includes a showcase of graphics made with geometry in Pygame as well.

The main file is main.py. There are four difficulties and ten bosses in total. The controls are:
<ul>
  <li>WASD: Move.</li>
  <li>Left Click: Fire Primary.</li>
  <li>Right Click: Fire Secondary.</li>
  <li>Space: Dash (you are invincible while dashing, but it has a cooldown).</li>
</ul>

The other file is "RainyOutlook.py", which is the opening screen of the game without any of the buttons or extra pieces of code.
